## **Introduction**  
  
The **ECS Tools** repository provides a suite of scripts and configurations designed to streamline the development and deployment processes for applications utilizing Amazon ECS. These tools aim to simplify tasks such as environment setup, container management, and integration with AWS services.  
  
## **Features**  
  
- **CI/CD Scripts**: Automate the build and deployment pipeline for ECS applications.  
- **Docker Configurations**: Predefined Dockerfiles and Compose files for setting up development and production environments.  
- **AWS Integration**: Scripts to facilitate interactions with AWS services like DynamoDB and S3.  
  
## **Prerequisites**
