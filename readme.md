## **Introduction**  
  
The **ECS Tools** repository provides a suite of scripts and configurations designed to streamline the development and deployment processes for applications utilizing Amazon ECS. These tools aim to simplify tasks such as environment setup, container management, and integration with AWS services.  
  
## **Features**  
  
- **CI/CD Scripts**: Automate the build and deployment pipeline for ECS applications.  
- **Docker Configurations**: Predefined Dockerfiles and Compose files for setting up development and production environments.  
- **AWS Integration**: Scripts to facilitate interactions with AWS services like DynamoDB and S3.  
  
## **Prerequisites**  
  
Before using the tools in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:  
  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)  
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)  
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
  
## **Installation**  
  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/acorelli/ecs-tools.git  
   cd ecs-tools  
   ```  
  
2. **Install Python Dependencies**:  
  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
  
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:  
    
   - Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.  
   - Update the `.env` file with your AWS credentials and other necessary configurations.  
    
## **Usage**    
  
### ** Setting Up Your AWS Environment**    
Before running any commands, make sure:  
- You have **AWS credentials configured** (via `aws configure` or environment variables).  
- Your **AWS CLI is authenticated**.

### ** Starting Your AWS Environment**  
  
To **initialize** and start your AWS environment (e.g., setting up S3 buckets, DynamoDB, and other AWS resources), use:  
  
```bash  
python easy_aws.py start
```  
  
This will:  
**Provision required AWS resources** (S3, DynamoDB, IAM roles, etc.).    
**Ensure services are running** with the correct configurations.    
**Verify connections** and check for potential issues.  
  
- **Docker Configurations**:  
  
  - **Dockerfile**: Use this file to build your application container.  
  - **Dockerfile.dynamodb**: A Dockerfile specifically for setting up a local DynamoDB instance.  
  - **docker-compose.yml**: Utilize Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.  
  
- **AWS Interaction Scripts**:  
  
  - **easy_aws.py**: A Python script to simplify common AWS operations.  
  - **ls3.ps1**: A PowerShell script for interacting with AWS S3 buckets.  
  - **docker_login.ps1**: A PowerShell script to facilitate Docker login processes.
